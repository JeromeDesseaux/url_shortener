# What is this project about

I wrote this simple project to show how to structure a basic API using Python, Docker, FastAPI & pytest. This is a result of a tutorial I wrote on my blog. I hope this may help you to understand some basic features of Python & code architecture / testing. 

# How to run

This project is "deployement ready". You should be able to run it executing the command `docker-compose up` (Please first install docker & docker-compose)
